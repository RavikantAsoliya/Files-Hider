# Files Hider

Files Hider is a Windows Forms application designed to provide a convenient way to hide files and folders. With Files Hider, you can easily select and hide specific files or entire folders within a user-friendly interface. Once hidden, these files and folders will no longer be visible in regular file explorers or directory listings.

This application offers a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to choose the files or folders they want to hide. Whether you want to keep certain files private or organize your content in a discreet manner, Files Hider provides a seamless solution. By hiding files and folders, you can maintain a higher level of privacy and security for your sensitive data. These hidden files remain accessible within the application itself, ensuring that only authorized users can access them.

Files Hider simplifies the process of hiding files and folders, allowing you to manage your hidden content effortlessly. It provides a hassle-free alternative to manually changing file attributes or navigating complex system settings.

With Files Hider, you can confidently hide your files and folders, knowing that they are secure and hidden from prying eyes. Take control of your privacy and keep your important data hidden with this reliable and user-friendly Windows Forms application.
