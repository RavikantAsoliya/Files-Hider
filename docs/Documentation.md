In future versions of FilesHider, additional options related to security, appearance, backup, and restore will be introduced. These options will enhance the software's functionality and provide users with even more control over their hidden files and folders.


<details><summary><b>Security <a name="security"></a></b></summary>
Enhancing the security of FilesHider is a crucial aspect. Some possible security enhancements include implementing advanced encryption algorithms to secure the hidden files and folders, adding two-factor authentication for an extra layer of login security, and integrating biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint or facial recognition.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Appearance <a name="appearance"></a></b></summary>
Improving the appearance of FilesHider can enhance the user experience. This could involve providing customizable themes and color schemes to personalize the app's interface, as well as allowing users to customize the app icon to blend in with other apps on their devices.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Backup and Restore <a name="backup-and-restore"></a></b></summary>
Integrating a comprehensive backup and restore feature can be beneficial. This feature would enable users to create regular backups of their hidden files and folders and easily restore them if needed. It could also include options for selecting specific files or folders for backup, scheduling automatic backups, and choosing the backup location.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Password Protection <a name="password-protection"></a></b></summary>
Implementing an additional layer of password protection can further secure FilesHider. This could involve setting a separate password or PIN for accessing the app itself, adding the option to set different passwords for different hidden files or folders, or implementing a master password feature for managing all passwords within the app.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Customizable Hotkeys <a name="customizable-hotkey"></a></b></summary>
Allowing users to set customizable hotkeys can provide quick and convenient access to FilesHider's features. Users can assign their preferred key combinations to perform actions such as opening or closing the app, hiding or revealing files, or locking and unlocking hidden content.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Search Functionality <a name=""></a></b></summary>
Incorporating a search functionality within FilesHider can simplify the process of finding specific hidden files or folders. This feature would allow users to search for files based on file names, tags, or metadata, saving time and effort in navigating through a large collection of hidden content.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Sorting and Grouping <a name=""></a></b></summary>
Enabling sorting and grouping options within FilesHider can enhance organization and ease of access. Users can choose to sort their hidden files and folders by various criteria such as name, date modified, file type, or size.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Multiple Profiles <a name=""></a></b></summary>
Introducing the ability to create multiple profiles within FilesHider can provide flexibility for different users or scenarios. Each profile could have its own set of hidden files, customized settings, and access privileges, allowing users to separate and manage different categories of hidden content.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Stealth Mode <a name=""></a></b></summary>
Enhancing the stealth mode feature can further protect the privacy of FilesHider. Advanced stealth mode can hide not only the application itself but also its presence in system logs, recent apps list, and other potentially revealing areas. This ensures that FilesHider remains discreet and difficult to detect.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Secure Deletion <a name=""></a></b></summary>
Implementing secure deletion options within FilesHider can ensure that deleted files are irrecoverable. This feature would use advanced deletion algorithms to overwrite the deleted files' data, making it virtually impossible to retrieve the content even with specialized recovery tools.
</details>

<details><summary><b>File Encryption <a name=""></a></b></summary>
Adding file encryption capabilities can provide an additional layer of protection for hidden files. This feature would allow users to encrypt individual files or entire folders within FilesHider using strong encryption algorithms. Encrypted files would require a decryption key or password to be accessed, adding another level of security.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Intrusion Detection <a name=""></a></b></summary>
Expanding the intrusion detection feature can help users identify and respond to potential security breaches. This could involve sending email or push notifications when unauthorized access attempts are detected, providing detailed logs and reports on intrusion attempts, and integrating with other security measures such as IP blocking or device lockdown.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Decoy Mode <a name=""></a></b></summary>
Implementing a decoy mode can add an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access. When activated, FilesHider would display a separate set of dummy or harmless files, folders, or content, while keeping the actual hidden files and folders securely concealed. This can confuse intruders and deter them from discovering the real hidden content.
